# Credit_card_default

## Overview
This is a classification model for a most common dataset, Credit Card defaulter prediction. Prediction of the next month credit card defaulter based on demographic and last six months behavioral data of customers.

## Motivation
A credit card default occurs when a cardholder fails to make the minimum required payments on their credit card account for an extended period of time. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a loss of income or an unexpected expense. When a credit card account goes into default, the card issuer may take legal action to collect the unpaid balance, and the cardholder's credit score may be negatively affected. 

Additionally, the card issuer may also charge additional fees or penalties. To avoid default, it is important for cardholders to make timely payments and to contact their issuer if they are having difficulty making payments.

Also, Banking or Financial Institutes plays a significant role in providing financial service. To maintain the integrity, bank must be careful when investing in customers to avoid financial loss. Before giving credit to borrowers, the bank must come to about the potential of customers. Therefore, goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.
